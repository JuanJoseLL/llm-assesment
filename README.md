I chose the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for this RAG ingestion pipeline because it hierarchically respects the natural structure of technical documents like aircraft manuals, starting with larger separators (e.g., double newlines for paragraphs) before falling back to finer ones (e.g., single newlines or spaces), which preserves semantic coherence and avoids arbitrary mid-sentence breaks that could degrade retrieval accuracy in vector stores. The chunk_size of 1000-1200 characters strikes an optimal balance: small enough to fit within typical LLM context windows and embedding limits (e.g., ~200-300 tokens for models like text-embedding-ada-002) while large enough to retain contextual integrity for dense, instructional content, minimizing fragmentation in queries about procedures or specifications. A 200-character overlap ensures continuity across chunks, reducing information loss at boundaries and improving recall during semantic search, especially for the voluminous Cessna manual (400+ pages) where cross-chunk references are common; this strategy, combined with add_start_index for traceability, enhances overall RAG efficiency without the computational overhead of more advanced semantic splitters, demonstrating scalability for mixed document sizes while prioritizing precision in aviation-technical domains.
